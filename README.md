# Supplier Selection using MCDM

This project demonstrates how to use **Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)** 
methods to evaluate and rank suppliers.

## Methods Implemented
- Entropy (for objective weighting)
- TOPSIS (for ranking alternatives)
- AHP / BWM (optional extensions)

## Example Criteria
- Cost
- Quality
- Delivery Time
- Flexibility
- Sustainability

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kongwengie/mcdm-supplier-selection.git
   cd mcdm-supplier-selection
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
